#### About Me

I'm an avid [modern C++](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines) developer with professional experience as a full-stack app developer in medical technology. Specifically, I also enjoy building scalable web-based [React](https://reactjs.org/)-UIs, preferably with a typechecking layer like TypeScript.

#### Misc

My personal interests range from science, coding and technology to music and learning Mandarin Chinese. Feel free to check out my old [heavy metal band](https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCBwgRRITnCBwppG9pRaIKqw).
